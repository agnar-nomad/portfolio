# Bankist demo app

This is a project built during the Complete JavaScript Course presented by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), accessed on Udemy.
The project was built in Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.

#### The app is a simple Internet Banking App simulator. Pre-existing users can transfer money, request a loan and check their balance or transaction history. A login timeout (as a security feature) has been implemented, which will log users out after a certain time of inactivity.

A live demo is available at this [URL](https://bankist-demo-agnar.netlify.app/).
