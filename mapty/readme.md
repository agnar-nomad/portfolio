# Mapty demo app

This is a project built during the Complete JavaScript Course presented by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), accessed on Udemy.

The project was built in Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS, using the open-source [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) JS library. The code utilises the OOP principles for better organisation and readability.

#### The app is a workout tracker, a diary of sort. Add your workouts (either Running or Cycling) and they will be saved as a pin on a map location, together with some additional data provided by you. The app keeps a history of the workouts so you can come back to see how you are progressing in your workout goals.

### Usage

- Open the app and allow GPS location access
- Upon the map opening, start adding entries by clicking on a location on the map
- The location will be marked and an input form shows for you to add some details of your workout
- Submit with the Enter key and the workout will be saved on your device's browser (stored in the browser's localStorage), meaning you can close the app, come back later and your data will be still available
- Click on a saved workout in the left-hand-side list to bring it up on the map
