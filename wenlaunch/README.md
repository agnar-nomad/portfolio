# Wenlaunch Web3 calendar

This is a Next.js ver 14 app using the `/app` directory.
It is an event calendar app, where users can submit, read and browse upcoming web3 events and releases.
Attached to it are a few Discord bots, that are able to submit themselves, but they also monitor user submissions and then propagate those on our Discord server.
