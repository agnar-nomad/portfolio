# Forkify demo app

This is a project built during the Complete JavaScript Course presented by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), accessed on Udemy.

The project was built in Vanilla Javascript using the latest ES6+ features, HTML and CSS, and a custom API built by Jonas. The code utilises the OOP principles for better organisation and readability. It also uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to build up the application.

#### The app is a collector's tool to find and store recipes for themselves. It accesses an impressive collection of recipes and makes it easy to see them, access them and save them for later use. Users can search, store or add recipes into the database.
