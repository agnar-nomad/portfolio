This is a good project to show I am able to build more complicated layouts. The top menu was an interesting challenge. The project uses only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

The body uses a nice element of image collages.

The footer uses a grid layout where the mobile version changes the order of the sections (pop up the newsletter signup to the first place), while the desktop version places the sections into a 3-repeat column layout, where the newsletter field is in the 3rd position.

The menu bars were the real CHALLENGE.
Building the hidden mobile menu was alright, where JS helps me unhide the menu on a click.
The desktop version was much more difficult, because the multi level organisation is very finicky. I know I did not do it the same way as they had, but it works. I managed to make the multi-level showing menu with the conditionally hidden buttons as well.

The website is responsive on mobile, its not perfect but is 100% usable.

The code can be certainly improved, the CSS could be more DRY.
